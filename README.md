# 🐍 Snake with Pygame

**Snake with Pygame** is a recreation of the classic Snake game developed using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
The project demonstrates core concepts of **game loops, collision detection, and event handling** in a simple yet engaging way.

## 🧠 Overview

This project was built to explore basic game development principles using **Pygame**,  
a popular Python library for 2D games.  
The player controls the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid collisions —  
just like the nostalgic mobile classic.
